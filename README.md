# OPINION MINING ON FEEDBACK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
In today’s environment where we’re suffering from data overload, companies have mountains of customer feedback collected. But for mere humans, it’s still impossible to analyze it manually without any error or bias. Often, companies with the best intentions find themselves in an insights vacuum for accurate decision making. Sentiment analysis (a form of text analytics) measures the customer's attitude towards the aspects of a service or product they describe in text. It typically involves taking a piece of text, whether it’s a sentence, a comment or an entire document, summarizing it into a few actionable insights and returning a “score” that measures how positive or negative the text is. Companies want their brand to be perceived positively. When looking to decrease customer churn, we use sentiment analysis to focus on the comments where the sentiment is strongly negative. Likewise, we look at customer comments which have a strong positive sentiment to find out why these customers love us, and try to focus on what we can do as a business to increase the Revenue / Profits / Brand value.
